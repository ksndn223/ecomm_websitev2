        <h2 className="mt-10 mb-2"> We create technologies that drive human progress</h2>
        <p> Our story began with a belief and a passion: that everybody should have easy access to the best technology anywhere in the world. 
            That was in 1984 in Michael Dellâ€™s University of Texas dorm room. Today, Dell Technologies is instrumental in changing the digital 
            landscape the world over. </p>
